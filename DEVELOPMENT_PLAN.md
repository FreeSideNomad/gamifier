# Gamifier Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the staged development approach for the Gamifier application, with each stage implemented as a feature branch, tested to >95% coverage, and integrated upon completion.

## Development Strategy
- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Each stage is developed in its own feature branch
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit and integration tests written before implementation
- **Coverage Requirements**: >95% line and branch coverage for each stage
- **Quality Gates**: All tests must pass before merging to main branch
- **Progressive Integration**: Each stage builds upon the previous foundation
